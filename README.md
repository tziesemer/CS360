Q: Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
A: This app needed to have a login screen where the user could login or create an account and a second screen where they could set a goal weight, add a new weight, edit the goal weight, edit any weight in the second screen table of weight entries or remove any of them. In addition, the app needed to ask the user for permission to send SMSs which would then be used if the user enters a weight that matches their goal weight to send them a congrats text.

Q: What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A: I created three screens by the end. First was the login, second was the main user interaction area, and the last was the add weight screen. These screens needed buttons to transition between eachother and should not block the user's progress through the app in either direction.

Q: How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
A: I started by basic planning of what features would be needed and how I could best provide them with my limited skills and time. Then I moved to the UI design and figuring out which elements the user would see and interact with. Taking that information I began to code out functionality piece by piece retesting eveything after every major change and making sure to troubleshoot until I found a solution when a featured stopped working after and update. Going forward I think I will continue the incremental step process so I can catch and correct errors early.

Q: How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
A: I wrote down a checklist of currently working features and requirements to run through each time I made a major change. I also tried seeing what I thought a user might do in order to find errors. These revealed that I needed more data validation and formating.

Q: Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
A: I had to massively innovate when it came to the actual coding of functionality as I ended up in a huge time crunch at that point and had to learn a lot with every feature I added.

Q: In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
A: I think I did the best during the UI design at least overall. I think I saw the most personal growth and overcoming of challenges durign the final coding and I showed myself that I can learn and troubleshoot through a lot in a short time but that might not be as apparent throught the end result. It would be like comparing a discussion I wrote over an entire day and a chemical setup I made in 10 minutes because I had no prior knowledge it was needed.
